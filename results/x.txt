       links recursively to collect pages.
     * Builds a mini crawler in Python with requests + BeautifulSoup
       (Books to Scrape demo).
     * Scales up with Scrapy (CrawlSpider + link rules) and exports

   Web crawling is a technique by which you can automatically navigate
   through multiple URLs and collect a tremendous amount of data. You can
   find all the URLs of multiple domains and extract information from
   them.

   This technique is mainly used by search engines like Google, Yahoo, and
   Bing to rank websites and suggest results to the user based on the
   query one makes.

   In this article, we are going to first understand the
   main [183]difference between web crawling and web scraping. This will
   help you create a thin line in your mind between web scraping and web
   crawling.

   Before we go in and create a full-fledged web crawler I will show you
   how you can create a small web crawler
   using [184]requests and [185]BeautifulSoup. This will give you a clear
   idea of what exactly a web crawler is. Then we will create a
   production-ready web crawler using [186]Scrapy.

What is web crawling?

   Web crawling is an automated bot whose job is to visit multiple URLs on
   a single website or multiple websites and download content from those
   pages. Then this data can be used for multiple purposes like price
   analysis, indexing on search engines, monitoring changes on websites,
   etc.

   It all starts with the seed URL which is the entry point of any web
   crawler. The web crawler then downloads HTML content from the page by
   making a GET request. The data downloaded is now parsed using various
   html parsing libraries to extract the most valuable data from it.

   Extracted data might contain links to other pages on the same website.
   Now, the crawler will make GET requests to these pages as well to
   repeat the same process that it did with the seed URL. Of course, this
   process is a recursive process that enables the script to visit every
   URL on the domain and gather all the information available.

How web crawling is different from web scraping?

   Web scraping and web crawling might sound similar but there is a fine
   line between them which makes them very different.

   Web scraping involves making a GET request to just one single page and
   extracting the data present on the page. It will not look for other
   URLs available on the page. Of course, web scraping is comparatively
   fast because it works on a single page only.

Web Crawling using Requests & BeautifulSoup

   In my experience, the combination of requests and BS4 is the best when
   it comes to downloading and parsing the raw HTML. If you want to learn
   more about the [188]best libraries for web scraping with Python then
   check out this guide,

   In this section, we will create a small crawler for this [189]website.
   So, according to the flowchart shown above the crawler will look for
   links right from the seed URL. The crawler will then go to each link
   and extract data.

   Let's first download these two libraries in the coding environment.

                                        pip install requests
pip install bs4


   We will be using another library urllib.parse but since it is a part of
   the Python standard library, there is no need for installation.

   A basic Python crawler for our target website will look like this.

                                        import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# URL of the website to crawl
base_url = "https://books.toscrape.com/"

# Set to store visited URLs
visited_urls = set()

# List to store URLs to visit next
urls_to_visit = [base_url]

# Function to crawl a page and extract links
def crawl_page(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

        # Extract links and enqueue new URLs
        links = []
        for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
            next_url = urljoin(url, link["href"])
            links.append(next_url)

        return links

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error crawling {url}: {e}")
        return []

# Crawl the website
while urls_to_visit:
    current_url = urls_to_visit.pop(0)  # Dequeue the first URL

    if current_url in visited_urls:
        continue

    print(f"Crawling: {current_url}")

    new_links = crawl_page(current_url)
    visited_urls.add(current_url)
    urls_to_visit.extend(new_links)

print("Crawling finished.")


   It is a very simple code but let me break it down and explain it to
   you.
    1. We import the required libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup,
       and urljoin from urllib.parse.
    2. We define the base_url of the website and initialize a
       set visited_urls to store visited URLs.
    3. We define a urls_to_visit list to store URLs that need to be
       crawled. We start with the base URL.
    4. We define the crawl_page() function to fetch a web page, parse its
       HTML content, and extract links from it.
    5. Inside the function, we use requests.get() to fetch the page
       and BeautifulSoup to parse its content.
    6. We iterate through each <a> tag to extract links, and convert them
       to absolute URLs using urljoin(), and add them to the links list.
    7. The while loop continues as long as there are URLs in
       the urls_to_visit list. For each URL, we:

     * Dequeue the URL and check if it has been visited before.
     * Call the crawl_page() function to fetch the page and extract links.
     * Add the current URL to the visited_urls set and enqueue the new
       links to urls_to_visit.

   8. Once the crawling process is complete, we print a message indicating
   that the process has finished.

   To run this code you can type this command on bash. I have named my
   file crawl.py.

                                        python crawl.py


   Once your crawler starts, this will appear on your screen.

   This code might give you an idea of how web crawling works. However,
   there are certain limitations and potential disadvantages to this code.
     * No Parallelism: The code does not utilize parallel processing,
       meaning that only one request is processed at a time. Parallelizing
       the crawling process can significantly improve the speed of
       crawling.
     * Lack of Error Handling: The code lacks detailed error handling for
       various scenarios, such as handling specific HTTP errors,
       connection timeouts, and more. Proper error handling is crucial for
       robust crawling.
     * Depth-First Crawling: The code uses a breadth-first approach, but
       in certain cases, depth-first crawling might be more efficient.
       This depends on the structure of the website and the goals of the
       crawling operation. If you want to learn more about BFS and DFS
       then read this [190]guide. BFS looks for the shortest path to reach
       the destination.

   In the next section, we are going to create a web crawler using Scrapy
   which will help us eliminate these limitations.

Web Crawler using Scrapy

   Again we are going to use the same [191]site for crawling with Scrapy.

   This page has a lot of information like warnings, titles, categories,
   etc. Our task would be to find links that match a certain pattern. For
   example, when we click on any of the categories we can see a certain
   pattern in the URL.

   Every URL will have /catalogue, /category and /books. But when we click
   on a book we only see /catalogue and nothing else.

   So, one task would be to instruct our web crawler to find all the links
   that have this pattern. The web crawler would then follow to find all
   the available links with /catalogue/category patterns in them. That
   would be the mission of our web crawler.

   In this case, it would be quite trivial because we have a sidebar where
   all the categories are listed but in a real-world project, you will
   oftentimes have something like maybe the top 10 categories that you can
   click and then there are a hundred more categories that you have to
   find by for example going into a book and then you have another 10
   sub-categories of the book present on that book page.

   So, you can instruct the crawler to go into all the different book
   pages to find all the secondary categories and then collect all the
   pages that are category pages.

   This could be the web crawling task and the web scraping task could be
   to collect titles and prices of the books from each dedicated book
   page. I hope you got the idea now. Let's proceed with the coding part!

   We will start with downloading Scrapy. It is a web scraping or web
   crawling framework. It is not just a simple library but an actual
   framework. Once you download this it will create multiple python files
   in your folder. You can type the following command in your cmd to
   install it.

                                        pip install scrapy


   Once you install it you can go back to your working directory and run
   this command.

                                        scrapy startproject learncrawling


   You can of course use whatever name you like. I have
   used learncrawling. Once the project is created you can see that in
   your chosen directory you have a new directory with the project name
   inside it.

   You will see a bunch of other Python files as well. We will cover some
   of these files later in this blog. But the most important directory
   here is the spider's directory. These are actually the constructs that
   we use for the web crawling process.

   We can create our own custom spiders to define our own crawling
   process. We are going to create a new Python file inside this.

   In this file, we are going to write some code.

                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor


    1. from scrapy.spider import CrawlSpider: This line imports
       the CrawlSpider class from the scrapy.spider module. CrawlSpider is
       a subclass of the base Spider class provided by Scrapy. It is used
       to create spider classes specifically designed for crawling
       websites by following links. Rule is used to define rules for link
       extraction and following.
    2. from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor: This line imports
       the LinkExtractor class from
       the scrapy.linkextractors module. LinkExtractor is a utility class
       provided by Scrapy to extract links from web pages based on
       specified rules and patterns.

   Then we want to create a new class which is going to be our custom
   spider class. I'm going to call this class CrawlingSpider and this is
   going to inherit from the CrawlSpider class.

                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]


    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
    )


   name = "mycrawler": This attribute specifies the name of the spider.
   The name is used to uniquely identify the spider when running Scrapy
   commands.

   allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]: This attribute defines a list of
   domain names that the spider is allowed to crawl. In this case, it
   specifies that the spider should only crawl within the domain
   "toscrape.com".

   start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]: This attribute provides a
   list of starting URLs for the spider. The spider will begin crawling
   from these URLs.

   Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),: This line defines a
   rule using the Rule class. It utilizes a LinkExtractor to extract links
   based on the provided rule. The allow parameter specifies a regular
   expression pattern that is used to match URLs. In this case, it's
   looking for URLs containing the text "catalogue/category".

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler


   Once it starts running you will see something like this on your bash.

   Our crawler is finding all these urls. But what if we want to find
   links to individual book pages as well and we want to scrape certain
   information from that?

   Now, we will look for certain things in our spiders and we will extract
   some data from each individual book page. For finding book pages I will
   define a new rule.

                                        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", de
ny="category"), callback="parse_item")


   This will find all the URLs with catalogue in it but it will deny the
   pages with category in them. Then we use a callback function to pass
   all of our crawled urls. This function will then handle the web
   scraping part.

What Will We Scrape

   We are going to scrape:
     * Title of the book
     * Price of the book
     * Availability

   Let's find out their DOM locations one by one.

   The title can be seen under the class product_main with h1 tags.

   Pricing can be seen under the p tag with class price_color.

   Availability can be seen under the p tag with class availability.

   Let's put all this under the code under parse_item() function.

                                        def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


     * yield { ... }: This line starts a dictionary comprehension enclosed
       within curly braces. This dictionary will be yielded as the output
       of the method, effectively passing the extracted data to Scrapy's
       output pipeline.
     * "title": response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(): This line
       extracts the text content of the <h1> element within
       the .product_main class using a CSS selector.
       The ::text pseudo-element is used to select the text content.
       The .get() method retrieves the extracted text.
     * "price": response.css(".price_color::text").get(): This line
       extracts the text content of the element with
       the .price_color class, similar to the previous line.
     * "availability":
       response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip(): This line
       extracts the text content of the third element with
       the .availability class on the page. [2] indicates that we're
       selecting the third matching element (remember that indexing is
       zero-based). The .get() method retrieves the text content.
       The strip() function is used to remove the white spaces.

   Our spider is now ready and we can run it from our terminal. Once again
   we are going to use the same command.

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler


   Let's run it and see the results. I am pretty excited.

   Our spider scrapes all the books and goes through all the instances
   that it can find. It will probably take some time but at the end, you
   will see all the extracted data. You can even notice the dictionary
   that is being printed, it contains all the data we wanted to scrape.

   What if I want to save this data?

Saving the data in a JSON file

   You can save this data into a JSON file very easily. You can do it
   directly from the bash, no need to make any changes in the code.

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler -o results.json


   This will then take all the scraped information and save it in a JSON
   file.

   We have got the title, price, and availability. You can of course play
   with it a little and extract the integer from the availability string
   using regex. But my purpose in this was to explain to you how it can be
   done fast and smoothly.

Web Crawling with Proxy

   One problem you might face in your web crawling journey is you might
   get blocked from accessing the website. This happens because you might
   be sending too many requests to the website due to which it might ban
   your IP. This will put a breakage to your data pipeline.

   In order to prevent this you can use proxy services that can handle IP
   rotations, and retries, and even pass appropriate headers to the
   website to act like a legit person rather than a data-hungry bot(of
   course we are).

   You can sign up for the free [192]datacenter proxy. You will get 1,000
   free credits to run a small crawler. Let's see how you can integrate
   this proxy into your Scrapy environment. There are mainly 3 steps
   involved while integrating your proxy in this.
    1. Define a constant PROXY_SERVER in your crawler_spider.py file.


                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]

    PROXY_SERVER = "http://scrapingdog:Your-API-Key@proxy.scrapingdog.com:8081"

    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", deny="category"), callback="parse_
item")
    )

    def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


   1. Then we will move to settings.py file. Find the downloader
   middlerwares section in this file and uncomment it.

                                        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
   'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware':1,
   'learncrawling.middlewares.LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware': 543,
}


   2. Then we will move to settings.py file. Find the downloader
   middlerwares section in this file and uncomment it.

                                        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
   'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware':1,
   'learncrawling.middlewares.LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware': 543,
}


   This will enable the use of a proxy.

   3. Then the final step would be to make changes in
   our middlewares.py file. In this file, you will find a class by the
   name LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware. From here we can manipulate the
   process of request-sending by adding the proxy server.

   Here you will find a function process_request() under which you have to
   add the below line.

                                        request.meta['proxy'] = "http://scraping
dog:Your-API-Key@proxy.scrapingdog.com:8081"
return None


   Now, every request will go through a proxy and your data pipeline will
   not get blocked.

   Of course, changing just the IP will not help you bypass the
   anti-scraping wall of any website therefore this proxy also passes
   custom headers to help you penetrate that wall.

   Now, Scrapy has certain limits when it comes to crawling. Let's say if
   you are crawling websites like Amazon using using Scrapy then you can
   scrape around 350 pages per minute(according to my own experiment).
   That means 50400 pages per day. This speed is not enough if you want to
   scrape millions of pages in just a few days. I came across
   this article where the author scraped more than 250 million pages
   within 40 hours. I would recommend reading this article.

   In some cases, you might have to wait to make another request
   like zoominfo.com. For that, you can use DOWNLOAD_DELAY to give your
   crawler a little rest. You can read more about it [193]here. This is
   how you can add this to your code.

                                        class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'my_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://example.com']

    download_delay = 1  # Set the delay to 1 second


   Then you can use CONCURRENT_REQUESTS to control the number of requests
   you want to send at a time. You can read more about it [194]here.

   You can also use ROBOTSTXT_OBEY to obey the rules set by the domain
   owners about data collection. Of course, as a data collector, you
   should respect their boundaries. You can read more about it [195]here.

Complete Code

   There are multiple data points available on this website which can also
   be scraped. But for now, the complete code for this tutorial will look
   like this.

                                        //crawling_spider.py

from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["http://books.toscrape.com/"]


    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", deny="category"), callback="parse_
item")
    )

    def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


Conclusion

   In this blog, we created a crawler using requests and Scrapy. Both are
   capable of achieving the target but with Scrapy you can complete the
   task fast. Scrapy provides you flexibility through which you can crawl
   endless websites with efficiency. Beginners might find Scrapy a little
   intimidating but once you get it you will be able to crawl websites
   very easily.

   I hope now you clearly understand the difference between web scraping
   and web crawling. The parse_item() function is doing web scraping once
   the URLs are crawled.

   I think you are now capable of crawling websites whose data matters.
   You can start with crawling Amazon and see how it goes. You can start
   by reading this guide on [196]web scraping Amazon with Python.

   I hope you like this tutorial and if you do then please do not forget
   to share it with your friends and on your social media.

   TL;DR
     * Explains crawling vs scraping; start from a seed URL and follow
       links recursively to collect pages.
     * Builds a mini crawler in Python with requests + BeautifulSoup
       (Books to Scrape demo).
     * Scales up with Scrapy (CrawlSpider + link rules) and exports

     * Scaling tips: use proxies (Scrapingdog datacenter proxy; 1k free
       credits), tune delays / concurrency, and respect robots.txt.

   Web crawling is a technique by which you can automatically navigate
   through multiple URLs and collect a tremendous amount of data. You can
   find all the URLs of multiple domains and extract information from
   them.

   This technique is mainly used by search engines like Google, Yahoo, and
   Bing to rank websites and suggest results to the user based on the
   query one makes.

   In this article, we are going to first understand the
   main [183]difference between web crawling and web scraping. This will
   help you create a thin line in your mind between web scraping and web
   crawling.

   Before we go in and create a full-fledged web crawler I will show you
   how you can create a small web crawler
   using [184]requests and [185]BeautifulSoup. This will give you a clear
   idea of what exactly a web crawler is. Then we will create a
   production-ready web crawler using [186]Scrapy.

What is web crawling?

   Web crawling is an automated bot whose job is to visit multiple URLs on
   a single website or multiple websites and download content from those
   pages. Then this data can be used for multiple purposes like price
   analysis, indexing on search engines, monitoring changes on websites,
   etc.

   It all starts with the seed URL which is the entry point of any web
   crawler. The web crawler then downloads HTML content from the page by
   making a GET request. The data downloaded is now parsed using various
   html parsing libraries to extract the most valuable data from it.

   Extracted data might contain links to other pages on the same website.
   Now, the crawler will make GET requests to these pages as well to
   repeat the same process that it did with the seed URL. Of course, this
   process is a recursive process that enables the script to visit every
   URL on the domain and gather all the information available.

How web crawling is different from web scraping?

   Web scraping and web crawling might sound similar but there is a fine
   line between them which makes them very different.

   Web scraping involves making a GET request to just one single page and
   extracting the data present on the page. It will not look for other
   URLs available on the page. Of course, web scraping is comparatively
   fast because it works on a single page only.

Web Crawling using Requests & BeautifulSoup

   In my experience, the combination of requests and BS4 is the best when
   it comes to downloading and parsing the raw HTML. If you want to learn
   more about the [188]best libraries for web scraping with Python then
   check out this guide,

   In this section, we will create a small crawler for this [189]website.
   So, according to the flowchart shown above the crawler will look for
   links right from the seed URL. The crawler will then go to each link
   and extract data.

   Let's first download these two libraries in the coding environment.

                                        pip install requests
pip install bs4


   We will be using another library urllib.parse but since it is a part of
   the Python standard library, there is no need for installation.

   A basic Python crawler for our target website will look like this.

                                        import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# URL of the website to crawl
base_url = "https://books.toscrape.com/"

# Set to store visited URLs
visited_urls = set()

# List to store URLs to visit next
urls_to_visit = [base_url]

# Function to crawl a page and extract links
def crawl_page(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors

        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

        # Extract links and enqueue new URLs
        links = []
        for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
            next_url = urljoin(url, link["href"])
            links.append(next_url)

        return links

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error crawling {url}: {e}")
        return []

# Crawl the website
while urls_to_visit:
    current_url = urls_to_visit.pop(0)  # Dequeue the first URL

    if current_url in visited_urls:
        continue

    print(f"Crawling: {current_url}")

    new_links = crawl_page(current_url)
    visited_urls.add(current_url)
    urls_to_visit.extend(new_links)

print("Crawling finished.")


   It is a very simple code but let me break it down and explain it to
   you.
    1. We import the required libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup,
       and urljoin from urllib.parse.
    2. We define the base_url of the website and initialize a
       set visited_urls to store visited URLs.
    3. We define a urls_to_visit list to store URLs that need to be
       crawled. We start with the base URL.
    4. We define the crawl_page() function to fetch a web page, parse its
       HTML content, and extract links from it.
    5. Inside the function, we use requests.get() to fetch the page
       and BeautifulSoup to parse its content.
    6. We iterate through each <a> tag to extract links, and convert them
       to absolute URLs using urljoin(), and add them to the links list.
    7. The while loop continues as long as there are URLs in
       the urls_to_visit list. For each URL, we:

     * Dequeue the URL and check if it has been visited before.
     * Call the crawl_page() function to fetch the page and extract links.
     * Add the current URL to the visited_urls set and enqueue the new
       links to urls_to_visit.

   8. Once the crawling process is complete, we print a message indicating
   that the process has finished.

   To run this code you can type this command on bash. I have named my
   file crawl.py.

                                        python crawl.py


   Once your crawler starts, this will appear on your screen.

   This code might give you an idea of how web crawling works. However,
   there are certain limitations and potential disadvantages to this code.
     * No Parallelism: The code does not utilize parallel processing,
       meaning that only one request is processed at a time. Parallelizing
       the crawling process can significantly improve the speed of
       crawling.
     * Lack of Error Handling: The code lacks detailed error handling for
       various scenarios, such as handling specific HTTP errors,
       connection timeouts, and more. Proper error handling is crucial for
       robust crawling.
     * Depth-First Crawling: The code uses a breadth-first approach, but
       in certain cases, depth-first crawling might be more efficient.
       This depends on the structure of the website and the goals of the
       crawling operation. If you want to learn more about BFS and DFS
       then read this [190]guide. BFS looks for the shortest path to reach
       the destination.

   In the next section, we are going to create a web crawler using Scrapy
   which will help us eliminate these limitations.

Web Crawler using Scrapy

   Again we are going to use the same [191]site for crawling with Scrapy.

   This page has a lot of information like warnings, titles, categories,
   etc. Our task would be to find links that match a certain pattern. For
   example, when we click on any of the categories we can see a certain
   pattern in the URL.

   Every URL will have /catalogue, /category and /books. But when we click
   on a book we only see /catalogue and nothing else.

   So, one task would be to instruct our web crawler to find all the links
   that have this pattern. The web crawler would then follow to find all
   the available links with /catalogue/category patterns in them. That
   would be the mission of our web crawler.

   In this case, it would be quite trivial because we have a sidebar where
   all the categories are listed but in a real-world project, you will
   oftentimes have something like maybe the top 10 categories that you can
   click and then there are a hundred more categories that you have to
   find by for example going into a book and then you have another 10
   sub-categories of the book present on that book page.

   So, you can instruct the crawler to go into all the different book
   pages to find all the secondary categories and then collect all the
   pages that are category pages.

   This could be the web crawling task and the web scraping task could be
   to collect titles and prices of the books from each dedicated book
   page. I hope you got the idea now. Let's proceed with the coding part!

   We will start with downloading Scrapy. It is a web scraping or web
   crawling framework. It is not just a simple library but an actual
   framework. Once you download this it will create multiple python files
   in your folder. You can type the following command in your cmd to
   install it.

                                        pip install scrapy


   Once you install it you can go back to your working directory and run
   this command.

                                        scrapy startproject learncrawling


   You can of course use whatever name you like. I have
   used learncrawling. Once the project is created you can see that in
   your chosen directory you have a new directory with the project name
   inside it.

   You will see a bunch of other Python files as well. We will cover some
   of these files later in this blog. But the most important directory
   here is the spider's directory. These are actually the constructs that
   we use for the web crawling process.

   We can create our own custom spiders to define our own crawling
   process. We are going to create a new Python file inside this.

   In this file, we are going to write some code.

                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor


    1. from scrapy.spider import CrawlSpider: This line imports
       the CrawlSpider class from the scrapy.spider module. CrawlSpider is
       a subclass of the base Spider class provided by Scrapy. It is used
       to create spider classes specifically designed for crawling
       websites by following links. Rule is used to define rules for link
       extraction and following.
    2. from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor: This line imports
       the LinkExtractor class from
       the scrapy.linkextractors module. LinkExtractor is a utility class
       provided by Scrapy to extract links from web pages based on
       specified rules and patterns.

   Then we want to create a new class which is going to be our custom
   spider class. I'm going to call this class CrawlingSpider and this is
   going to inherit from the CrawlSpider class.

                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]


    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
    )


   name = "mycrawler": This attribute specifies the name of the spider.
   The name is used to uniquely identify the spider when running Scrapy
   commands.

   allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]: This attribute defines a list of
   domain names that the spider is allowed to crawl. In this case, it
   specifies that the spider should only crawl within the domain
   "toscrape.com".

   start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]: This attribute provides a
   list of starting URLs for the spider. The spider will begin crawling
   from these URLs.

   Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),: This line defines a
   rule using the Rule class. It utilizes a LinkExtractor to extract links
   based on the provided rule. The allow parameter specifies a regular
   expression pattern that is used to match URLs. In this case, it's
   looking for URLs containing the text "catalogue/category".

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler


   Once it starts running you will see something like this on your bash.

   Our crawler is finding all these urls. But what if we want to find
   links to individual book pages as well and we want to scrape certain
   information from that?

   Now, we will look for certain things in our spiders and we will extract
   some data from each individual book page. For finding book pages I will
   define a new rule.

                                        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", de
ny="category"), callback="parse_item")


   This will find all the URLs with catalogue in it but it will deny the
   pages with category in them. Then we use a callback function to pass
   all of our crawled urls. This function will then handle the web
   scraping part.

What Will We Scrape

   We are going to scrape:
     * Title of the book
     * Price of the book
     * Availability

   Let's find out their DOM locations one by one.

   The title can be seen under the class product_main with h1 tags.

   Pricing can be seen under the p tag with class price_color.

   Availability can be seen under the p tag with class availability.

   Let's put all this under the code under parse_item() function.

                                        def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


     * yield { ... }: This line starts a dictionary comprehension enclosed
       within curly braces. This dictionary will be yielded as the output
       of the method, effectively passing the extracted data to Scrapy's
       output pipeline.
     * "title": response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(): This line
       extracts the text content of the <h1> element within
       the .product_main class using a CSS selector.
       The ::text pseudo-element is used to select the text content.
       The .get() method retrieves the extracted text.
     * "price": response.css(".price_color::text").get(): This line
       extracts the text content of the element with
       the .price_color class, similar to the previous line.
     * "availability":
       response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip(): This line
       extracts the text content of the third element with
       the .availability class on the page. [2] indicates that we're
       selecting the third matching element (remember that indexing is
       zero-based). The .get() method retrieves the text content.
       The strip() function is used to remove the white spaces.

   Our spider is now ready and we can run it from our terminal. Once again
   we are going to use the same command.

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler


   Let's run it and see the results. I am pretty excited.

   Our spider scrapes all the books and goes through all the instances
   that it can find. It will probably take some time but at the end, you
   will see all the extracted data. You can even notice the dictionary
   that is being printed, it contains all the data we wanted to scrape.

   What if I want to save this data?

Saving the data in a JSON file

   You can save this data into a JSON file very easily. You can do it
   directly from the bash, no need to make any changes in the code.

                                        scrapy crawl mycrawler -o results.json


   This will then take all the scraped information and save it in a JSON
   file.

   We have got the title, price, and availability. You can of course play
   with it a little and extract the integer from the availability string
   using regex. But my purpose in this was to explain to you how it can be
   done fast and smoothly.

Web Crawling with Proxy

   One problem you might face in your web crawling journey is you might
   get blocked from accessing the website. This happens because you might
   be sending too many requests to the website due to which it might ban
   your IP. This will put a breakage to your data pipeline.

   In order to prevent this you can use proxy services that can handle IP
   rotations, and retries, and even pass appropriate headers to the
   website to act like a legit person rather than a data-hungry bot(of
   course we are).

   You can sign up for the free [192]datacenter proxy. You will get 1,000
   free credits to run a small crawler. Let's see how you can integrate
   this proxy into your Scrapy environment. There are mainly 3 steps
   involved while integrating your proxy in this.
    1. Define a constant PROXY_SERVER in your crawler_spider.py file.


                                        from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider,
Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["https://books.toscrape.com/"]

    PROXY_SERVER = "http://scrapingdog:Your-API-Key@proxy.scrapingdog.com:8081"

    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", deny="category"), callback="parse_
item")
    )

    def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


   1. Then we will move to settings.py file. Find the downloader
   middlerwares section in this file and uncomment it.

                                        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
   'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware':1,
   'learncrawling.middlewares.LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware': 543,
}


   2. Then we will move to settings.py file. Find the downloader
   middlerwares section in this file and uncomment it.

                                        DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
   'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware':1,
   'learncrawling.middlewares.LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware': 543,
}


   This will enable the use of a proxy.

   3. Then the final step would be to make changes in
   our middlewares.py file. In this file, you will find a class by the
   name LearncrawlingDownloaderMiddleware. From here we can manipulate the
   process of request-sending by adding the proxy server.

   Here you will find a function process_request() under which you have to
   add the below line.

                                        request.meta['proxy'] = "http://scraping
dog:Your-API-Key@proxy.scrapingdog.com:8081"
return None


   Now, every request will go through a proxy and your data pipeline will
   not get blocked.

   Of course, changing just the IP will not help you bypass the
   anti-scraping wall of any website therefore this proxy also passes
   custom headers to help you penetrate that wall.

   Now, Scrapy has certain limits when it comes to crawling. Let's say if
   you are crawling websites like Amazon using using Scrapy then you can
   scrape around 350 pages per minute(according to my own experiment).
   That means 50400 pages per day. This speed is not enough if you want to
   scrape millions of pages in just a few days. I came across
   this article where the author scraped more than 250 million pages
   within 40 hours. I would recommend reading this article.

   In some cases, you might have to wait to make another request
   like zoominfo.com. For that, you can use DOWNLOAD_DELAY to give your
   crawler a little rest. You can read more about it [193]here. This is
   how you can add this to your code.

                                        class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'my_spider'
    start_urls = ['https://example.com']

    download_delay = 1  # Set the delay to 1 second


   Then you can use CONCURRENT_REQUESTS to control the number of requests
   you want to send at a time. You can read more about it [194]here.

   You can also use ROBOTSTXT_OBEY to obey the rules set by the domain
   owners about data collection. Of course, as a data collector, you
   should respect their boundaries. You can read more about it [195]here.

Complete Code

   There are multiple data points available on this website which can also
   be scraped. But for now, the complete code for this tutorial will look
   like this.

                                        //crawling_spider.py

from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor



class CrawlingSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = "mycrawler"
    allowed_domains = ["toscrape.com"]
    start_urls = ["http://books.toscrape.com/"]


    rules = (
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue/category")),
        Rule(LinkExtractor(allow="catalogue", deny="category"), callback="parse_
item")
    )

    def parse_item(self,response):

        yield {
            "title":response.css(".product_main h1::text").get(),
            "price":response.css(".price_color::text").get(),
            "availability":response.css(".availability::text")[1].get().strip()
        }


Conclusion

   In this blog, we created a crawler using requests and Scrapy. Both are
   capable of achieving the target but with Scrapy you can complete the
   task fast. Scrapy provides you flexibility through which you can crawl
   endless websites with efficiency. Beginners might find Scrapy a little
   intimidating but once you get it you will be able to crawl websites
   very easily.

   I hope now you clearly understand the difference between web scraping
   and web crawling. The parse_item() function is doing web scraping once
   the URLs are crawled.

   I think you are now capable of crawling websites whose data matters.
   You can start with crawling Amazon and see how it goes. You can start
   by reading this guide on [196]web scraping Amazon with Python.

   I hope you like this tutorial and if you do then please do not forget
   to share it with your friends and on your social media.
